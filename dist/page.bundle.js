/**
 * An IndexedDB-backed instance of Persistence. Data is stored persistently
 * across sessions.
 *
 * On Web only, the Firestore SDKs support shared access to its persistence
 * layer. This allows multiple browser tabs to read and write to IndexedDb and
 * to synchronize state even without network connectivity. Shared access is
 * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke
 * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.
 *
 * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK
 * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick
 * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is
 * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary
 * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to
 * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to
 * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as
 * primary.
 *
 * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only
 * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of
 * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence
 * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see
 * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from
 * persistence.
 *
 * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary
 * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as
 * the addition of new mutations and query targets.
 *
 * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary
 * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent
 * operations will automatically fail.
 *
 * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the
 * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make
 * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary
 * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload
 * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the
 * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a "zombiedClient" entry in
 * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and
 * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.
 *
 * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no
 * longer optional.

/**
 * The Firestore query engine.
 *
 * Firestore queries can be executed in three modes. The Query Engine determines
 * what mode to use based on what data is persisted. The mode only determines
 * the runtime complexity of the query - the result set is equivalent across all
 * implementations.
 *
 * The Query engine will use indexed-based execution if a user has configured
 * any index that can be used to execute query (via `setIndexConfiguration()`).
 * Otherwise, the engine will try to optimize the query by re-using a previously
 * persisted query result. If that is not possible, the query will be executed
 * via a full collection scan.
 *
 * Index-based execution is the default when available. The query engine
 * supports partial indexed execution and merges the result from the index
 * lookup with documents that have not yet been indexed. The index evaluation
 * matches the backend's format and as such, the SDK can use indexing for all
 * queries that the backend supports.
 *
 * If no index exists, the query engine tries to take advantage of the target
 * document mapping in the TargetCache. These mappings exists for all queries
 * that have been synced with the backend at least once and allow the query
 * engine to only read documents that previously matched a query plus any
 * documents that were edited after the query was last listened to.
 *
 * There are some cases when this optimization is not guaranteed to produce
 * the same results as full collection scans. In these cases, query
 * processing falls back to full scans. These cases are:
 *
 * - Limit queries where a document that matched the query previously no longer
 *   matches the query.
 *
 * - Limit queries where a document edit may cause the document to sort below
 *   another document that is in the local cache.
 *
 * - Queries that have never been CURRENT or free of limbo documents.

/**
 * A PersistentStream is an abstract base class that represents a streaming RPC
 * to the Firestore backend. It's built on top of the connections own support
 * for streaming RPCs, and adds several critical features for our clients:
 *
 *   - Exponential backoff on failure
 *   - Authentication via CredentialsProvider
 *   - Dispatching all callbacks into the shared worker queue
 *   - Closing idle streams after 60 seconds of inactivity
 *
 * Subclasses of PersistentStream implement serialization of models to and
 * from the JSON representation of the protocol buffers for a specific
 * streaming RPC.
 *
 * ## Starting and Stopping
 *
 * Streaming RPCs are stateful and need to be start()ed before messages can
 * be sent and received. The PersistentStream will call the onOpen() function
 * of the listener once the stream is ready to accept requests.
 *
 * Should a start() fail, PersistentStream will call the registered onClose()
 * listener with a FirestoreError indicating what went wrong.
 *
 * A PersistentStream can be started and stopped repeatedly.

 *  SendType: The type of the outgoing message of the underlying
